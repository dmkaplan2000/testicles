Description: 'rticles' provides the capability of writing papers in Rmarkdown, but
    each journal format has its own style for the Rmarkdown document and some formats
    currently lack features that would be useful. The goal of this package is to 
    provide a standard "universal" template for an 'rticles' Rmarkdown document that
    has the minimum set of features that should be shared by all journal formats and
    test that those features work with all 'rticles' templates.
